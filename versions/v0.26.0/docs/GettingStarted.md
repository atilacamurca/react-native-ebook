## Installation

### Required Prerequisites

#### Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), in order to install the required NodeJS, in addition to some
recommended installs.

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

#### Node

Use Homebrew to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

> NodeJS 4.0 or greater is required for React Native. The default Homebrew package for Node is
> currently 6.0, so that is not an issue.  

```
brew install node
```

#### React Native Command Line Tools

The React Native command line tools allow you to easily create and initialize projects, etc.

```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

> If you see the error, `EACCES: permission denied`, please run the command:
> `sudo npm install -g react-native-cli`.

<block class="mac ios" />

#### Xcode

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) 7.0 or higher. Open the App Store or go to https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/. This will also install `git` as well.

<block class="mac android" />

#### Android Studio

[Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) 2.0 or higher.

> Android Studio requires the Java Development Kit [JDK] 1.8 or higher. You can type
> `javac -version` to see what version you have, if any. If you do not meet the JDK requirement,
> you can
> [download it](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

Android Studio will provide you the Android SDK and emulator required to run and test your React
Native apps.

> Unless otherwise mentioned, keep all the setup defaults intact. For example, the
> `Android Support Repository` is installed automatically with Android Studio, and we need that
> for React Native.

You will need to customize your installation:

- Choose a `Custom` installation

![custom installation](img/react-native-android-studio-custom-install.png)

- Choose both `Performance` and `Android Virtual Device`

![additional installs](img/react-native-android-studio-additional-installs.png)

- After installation, choose `Configure | SDK Manager` from the Android Studio welcome window.

![configure sdk](img/react-native-android-studio-configure-sdk.png)

- In the `SDK Platforms` window, choose `Show Package Details` and under `Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)`, make sure that `Google APIs`, `Intel x86 Atom System Image`, `Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image`, and `Google APIs Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image` are checked.

![platforms](img/react-native-android-studio-android-sdk-platforms.png)

- In the `SDK Tools` window, choose `Show Package Details` and under `Android SDK Build Tools`, make sure that `Android SDK Build-Tools 23.0.1` is selected.

![build tools](img/react-native-android-studio-android-sdk-build-tools.png)

#### ANDROID_HOME Environment Variable

Ensure the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable points to your existing Android SDK. To do that, add
this to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile` (or whatever your shell uses) and re-open your terminal:

```
# If you installed the SDK without Android Studio, then it may be something like:
# /usr/local/opt/android-sdk
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
```

<block class="mac ios android" />

### Highly Recommended Installs

#### Watchman

[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) is a tool by Facebook for watching
changes in the filesystem. It is recommended you install it for better performance.

```
brew install watchman
```

#### Flow

[Flow](http://www.flowtype.org), for static typechecking of your React Native code (when using
Flow as part of your codebase).


```
brew install flow
```

<block class="mac android" />

#### Add Android Tools Directory to your `PATH`

You can add the Android tools directory on your `PATH` in case you need to run any of the Android
tools from the command line such as `android avd`. In your `~/.bash` or `~/.bash_profile`:

```
# Your exact string here may be different.
PATH="~/Library/Android/sdk/tools:~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:${PATH}"
export PATH
```

#### Gradle Daemon

Enable [Gradle Daemon](https://docs.gradle.org/2.9/userguide/gradle_daemon.html) which greatly improves incremental build times for changes in java code.

### Other Optional Installs

#### Git

Git version control. If you have installed [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), Git is
already installed, otherwise run the following:

```
brew install git
```

<block class="mac ios android" />

#### Nuclide

[Nuclide](http://nuclide.io) is an IDE from Facebook providing a first-class development environment
for writing, [running](http://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/#running-applications) and
[debugging](http://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/#debugging)
[React Native](http://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/) applications.

Get started with Nuclide [here](http://nuclide.io/docs/quick-start/getting-started/).

#### Genymotion

Genymotion is an alternative to the stock Google emulator that comes with Android Studio.
However, it's only free for personal use. If you want to use the stock Google emulator, see below.

1. Download and install [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/).
2. Open Genymotion. It might ask you to install VirtualBox unless you already have it.
3. Create a new emulator and start it.
4. To bring up the developer menu press âŒ˜+M

### Troubleshooting

#### Virtual Device Not Created When Installing Android Studio

There is a [known bug](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=207563) on some versions
of Android Studio where a virtual device will not be created, even though you selected it in the
installation sequence. You may see this at the end of the installation:

```
Creating Android virtual device
Unable to create a virtual device: Unable to create Android virtual device
```

If you see this, run `android avd` and create the virtual device manually.

![avd](img/react-native-android-studio-avd.png)

Then select the new device in the AVD Manager window and click `Start...`.

#### Shell Command Unresponsive Exception

If you encounter:

```
Execution failed for task ':app:installDebug'.
  com.android.builder.testing.api.DeviceException: com.android.ddmlib.ShellCommandUnresponsiveException
```

try downgrading your Gradle version to 1.2.3 in `<project-name>/android/build.gradle` (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/2720)

<block class="mac ios android" />

## Testing Installation

<block class="mac ios" />

```
react-native init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run-ios
```

> You can also
> [open the `AwesomeProject`](http://nuclide.io/docs/quick-start/getting-started/#adding-a-project)
> folder in [Nuclide](http://nuclide.io) and
> [run the application](http://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/#command-line), or open
> `ios/AwesomeProject.xcodeproj` and hit the `Run` button in Xcode.

<block class="mac android" />

```
react-native init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run-android
```

> You can also
> [open the `AwesomeProject`](http://nuclide.io/docs/quick-start/getting-started/#adding-a-project)
> folder in [Nuclide](http://nuclide.io) and
> [run the application](http://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/#command-line).

<block class="mac ios android" />

### Modifying Project

Now that you successfully started the project, let's modify it:

<block class="mac ios" />

- Open `index.ios.js` in your text editor of choice (e.g. [Nuclide](http://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/)) and edit some lines.
- Hit âŒ˜-R in your iOS simulator to reload the app and see your change!

<block class="mac android" />

- Open `index.android.js` in your text editor of choice (e.g. [Nuclide](http://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/)) and edit some lines.
- Press the `R` key twice **OR** open the menu (F2 by default, or âŒ˜-M in Genymotion) and select Reload JS to see your change!
- Run `adb logcat *:S ReactNative:V ReactNativeJS:V` in a terminal to see your app's logs

<block class="mac ios android" />

### That's It

Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.

<center><img src="img/react-native-congratulations.png" width="150"></img></center>

<block class="windows linux android" />

## Testing Installation

```
react-native init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run-android
```

<block class="windows linux android" />

### Troubleshooting Run

A common issue is that the packager is not started automatically when you run
`react-native run-android`. You can start it manually using:

```
cd AwesomeProject
react-native start
```

<block class="windows android" />

Or if you hit a `ERROR  Watcher took too long to load` on Windows, try increasing the timeout in [this file](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/5fa33f3d07f8595a188f6fe04d6168a6ede1e721/packager/react-packager/src/DependencyResolver/FileWatcher/index.js#L16) (under your `node_modules/react-native/`).

<block class="windows linux android" />

### Modifying Project

Now that you successfully started the project, let's modify it:

- Open `index.android.js` in your text editor of choice (e.g. [Nuclide](http://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/)) and edit some lines.
- Press the `R` key twice **OR** open the menu (F2 by default, or ctrl-M in the emulator) and select Reload JS to see your change!
- Run `adb logcat *:S ReactNative:V ReactNativeJS:V` in a terminal to see your app's logs
