## Tips on managing GitHub issues efficiently

### An issue is a duplicate of another issue
Comment e.g. `@facebook-github-bot duplicate #123`. This will add a comment and close the issue.
Example: [#5977](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/5977)

### An issue is a question
Questions should absolutely be asked on StackOverflow rather than GitHub.
Comment `@facebook-github-bot stack-overflow` to close the issue.
Examples: [#6378](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6378), [#6015](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6015), [#6059](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6059), [#6062](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6062).
Feel free to also answer some [SO questions](stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native), you'll get rep :)

### An issue is a question that's been answered
Sometimes and issue has been resolved in the comments.
Comment `@facebook-github-bot answered` to close it.
Example: [#6045](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6045)

### An issue needs more information
It is impossible to understand and reproduce the issue without more information, e.g. a short code sample, screenshot.
Do the following:
- Explain what additional info you need to understand the issue
- Comment `@facebook-github-bot label Needs more information`
Examples: [#6056](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6056), [#6008](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6008), [#5491](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/5491)

### An issue with label 'Needs more information' has been open for more than a week
Comment mentioning the author asking if they plan to provide the additional information. If they don't come back close the issue using `@facebook-github-bot no-reply`.
Example: [#6056](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6056)

### An issue is a valid bug report
Valid bug reports with good repro steps are some of the best issues! Thank the author for finding it, explain that React Native is a community project and **ask them if they would be up for sending a fix**.

### An issue is a feature request. The feature shouldn't be in the code and don't want to maintain it.
This especially includes **new modules** Facebook doesn't use in production. Explain that those modules should be released to npm separately and that everyone will still be able to use the module super easily that way.

### An issue is a feature request, you're pretty sure we should maintain this feature as part of RN
This should be rare - adding a new feature means maintaining it.
Tell the author something like: "Pull requests are welcome. In case you're not up for sending a PR, you should post to [Product Pains](https://productpains.com/product/react-native/?tab=top). It has a voting system and if the feature gets upvoted enough it might get implemented."

### How to add a label
Add any relevant labels, for example 'Android', 'iOS'.
Comment e.g. `@facebook-github-bot label Android`

### How to reopen a closed issue
For example an issue was closed waiting for the author, the author replied and it turns out this is indeed a bug.
Comment `@facebook-github-bot reopen`

### What are all the available commands for the bot?
When you mention the bot, it follows the commands defined in [IssueCommands.txt](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/bots/IssueCommands.txt).
